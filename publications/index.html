These attacks evolve rapidly, demonstrate high creativity, and boast superior attack success rates. To combat such threats, we propose a promising approach to enhancing LLM safety by leveraging the underlying geometry of input prompt token embeddings using hypergraphs. This approach allows us to model the differences in information flow between benign and malicious LLM prompts. In our approach, each LLM prompt is represented as a metric hypergraph, forming a compact metric space. We then construct a higher-order metric space over these compact metric hypergraphs using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance as a generalized metric. Within this space of metric hypergraph spaces, our safety filter learns to classify between harmful and benign prompts. Our study presents theoretical guarantees on the classifier’s generalization error for novel and unseen LLM input prompts. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both existing state-of-the-art generic defense mechanisms and naive baselines. Notably, our approach also achieves comparable performance to specialized defenses against algorithm-focused attacks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICLR</abbr> </div> <div id="ramesh2025efficient" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">EFFICIENT JAILBREAK ATTACK SEQUENCES ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS VIA MULTI-ARMED BANDIT-BASED CONTEXT SWITCHING</div> <div class="author"> Aditya Ramesh, Shivam Bhardwaj, Aditya Saibewar, and <em>Manohar Kaul</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jCDF7G3LpF" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Content warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and content. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made them increasingly vulnerable to jailbreaking attempts, where malicious users manipulate models into generating harmful content. While existing approaches rely on either single-step attacks that trigger immediate safety responses or multi-step methods that inefficiently iterate prompts using other LLMs, we introduce “Sequence of Context" (SoC) attacks that systematically alter conversational context through strategically crafted context-switching queries (CSQs). We formulate this as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) optimization problem, automatically learning optimal sequences of CSQs that gradually weaken the model’s safety boundaries. Our theoretical analysis provides tight bounds on both the expected sequence length until successful jailbreak and the convergence of cumulative rewards. Empirically, our method achieves a 95% attack success rate, surpassing PAIR by 63.15%, AutoDAN by 60%, and ReNeLLM by 50%. We evaluate our attack across multiple open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral variants. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safeguards and emphasize the need for defenses that consider sequential attack patterns rather than relying solely on static prompt filtering or iterative refinement.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NAACL</abbr> </div> <div id="anonymous2025safequant" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SafeQuant: LLM Safety Analysis via Quantized Gradient Inspection</div> <div class="author"> Sindhu Padakandla, Sadbhavana Babar, Rathod Darshan D, and <em>Manohar Kaul</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the ACL</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=vzE3sdsZub" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Contemporary jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) employ sophisticated techniques with obfuscated content to bypass safety guardrails. Existing defenses either use computationally intensive LLM verification or require adversarial fine-tuning, leaving models vulnerable to advanced attacks. We introduce SafeQuant, a novel defense framework that leverages quantized gradient patterns to identify harmful prompts efficiently. Our key insight is that when generating identical responses like "Sure", LLMs exhibit distinctly different internal gradient patterns for safe versus harmful prompts, reflecting conflicts with safety training. By capturing these patterns through selective gradient masking and quantization, SafeQuant significantly outperforms existing defenses across multiple benchmarks while maintaining model utility. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness against sophisticated attacks like WordGame prompts and persuasive adversarial attacks, achieving an F1-score of 0.80 on WordGame dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods like GradSafe by an absolute margin of 57%. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">WACV</abbr> </div> <div id="Sai_2025_WACV" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning Semantic Part-Based Graph Structure for 3D Point Cloud Domain Generalization</div> <div class="author"> G Ujwal Sai, Arkadipta De, Vartika Sengar, Anuj Rathore, Daksh Thapar, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

These CL objective functions can be posed as a supervised discriminative task using *’hard’* labels that consider any minor augmented pairs of graphs as ’equally positive’. However, such a notion of ’equal’ pairs is incorrect for graphs as even a smaller ’discrete’ perturbation may lead to large semantic changes that should be carefully encapsulated within the learned representations. This paper proposes a novel CL framework for GNNs, called *Teacher-guided Graph Contrastive Learning (TGCL)*, that incorporates ’soft’ pseudo-labels to facilitate a more regularized discrimination. In particular, we propose a teacher-student framework where the student learns the representation by distilling the teacher’s perception. Our TGCL framework can be adapted to existing CL methods to enhance their performance. Our empirical findings validate these claims on both inductive and transductive settings across diverse downstream tasks, including molecular graphs and social networks. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently improves the average AUROC scores for molecules’ property prediction and social network link prediction.

The point cloud data acquisition procedures manifest themselves as significant domain discrepancies and geometric variations among both similar and dissimilar classes. The standard domain adaptation methods developed for images do not directly translate to point cloud data because of their complex geometric nature. To address this challenge, we leverage the idea of multimodality and alignment between distributions. We propose a new UDA architecture for point cloud classification that benefits from multimodal contrastive learning to get better class separation in both domains individually. Further, the use of optimal transport (OT) aims at learning source and target data distributions jointly to reduce the cross-domain shift and provide a better alignment. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on GraspNetPC-10 (with approx 4-12% margin) and best average performance on PointDA-10. Our ablation studies and decision boundary analysis also validate the significance of our contrastive learning module and OT alignment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ACL</abbr> </div> <div id="PandaADKP24" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">HOLMES: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs for Multi-hop Question Answering using LLMs</div> <div class="author"> Pranoy Panda, Ankush Agarwal, Chaitanya Devaguptapu, <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, and Prathosh A P </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), ACL 2024, Bangkok, Thailand, August 11-16, 2024</em>, Feb 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Given unstructured text, Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at answering simple (single-hop) questions. However, as the complexity of the questions increase, the performance of LLMs degrade. We believe this is due to the overhead associated with understanding the complex question followed by filtering and aggregating unstructured information in the raw text. Recent methods try to reduce this burden by integrating structured knowledge triples into the raw text, aiming to provide a structured overview that simplifies information processing. However, this simplistic approach is query-agnostic and the extracted facts are ambiguous as they lack context. To address these drawbacks and to enable LLMs to answer complex (multi-hop) questions with ease, we propose to use a knowledge graph (KG) that is context-aware and is distilled to contain query-relevant information. The use of our compressed distilled KG as input to the LLM results in our method utilizing up to 67% fewer tokens to represent the query relevant information present in the supporting documents, compared to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) method. Our experiments show consistent improvements over the SoTA across several metrics (EM, F1, BERTScore, and Human Eval) on two popular benchmark datasets (HotpotQA and MuSiQue).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">TAG-ML</abbr> </div> <div id="CloningerDEKKKM22" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Preface</div> <div class="author"> Alexander Cloninger, Timothy Doster, Tegan Emerson, <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, Ira Ktena, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

We add two more realistic restrictions on the attack methods, namely limiting the number of queries allowed (query budget) and crafting attacks that easily transfer across different pre-trained models (transferability), which render previous attack models impractical and ineffective. Here, we propose a target model agnostic adversarial attack method with a high degree of attack transferability across the attacked models.

In spite of the ubiquitous presence of such higher-order interactions, limited attention has been paid to the higher-order counterpart of the popular pairwise link prediction problem. Existing higher-order structure prediction methods are mostly based on heuristic feature extraction procedures, which work well in practice but lack theoretical guarantees. Such heuristics are primarily focused on predicting links in a static snapshot of the graph. Moreover, these heuristic-based methods fail to effectively utilize and benefit from the knowledge of latent substructures already present within the higher-order structures. In this paper, we overcome these obstacles by capturing higher-order interactions succinctly as simplices, model their neighborhood by face-vectors, and develop a nonparametric kernel estimator for simplices that views the evolving graph from the perspective of a time process (i.e., a sequence of graph snapshots).

Recently, deep neural networks operating on labeled point clouds have shown promising results on supervised learning tasks like classification and segmentation. However, supervised learning leads to the cumbersome task of annotating the point clouds. To combat this problem, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks that encode a hierarchical partitioning of the point clouds using a cover-tree, where point cloud subsets lie within balls of varying radii at each level of the cover-tree. Furthermore, our self-supervised learning network is restricted to pre-train on the support set (comprising of scarce training examples) used to train the downstream network in a few-shot learning (FSL) setting. Finally, the fully-trained self-supervised network’s point embeddings are used to initialize the downstream task’s network. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our method on both downstream classification and segmentation tasks and show that supervised methods pre-trained with our self-supervised learning method significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods.

Although currently, several existing methods ’flatten’ such 3D images to use planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching. Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on these warped images persists as a formidable challenge. In this paper, we pose the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of the simplicial complexes, iterating from the highest to the lowest dimension. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are illustrated on both synthetic and real-world spherical / warped (projected) images with known ground-truth correspondences.

In particular, our biased walk, with a certain probability, favors movement towards nodes whose neighborhoods bear a structural resemblance to the current node’s neighborhood. We succinctly capture this neighborhood as a probability measure based on the spectrum of the node’s neighborhood subgraph represented as a normalized Laplacian matrix.

Here, we present an approach where a probability measure is assigned to each graph based on the spectrum of the graph’s normalized Laplacian. This enables us to accordingly cluster the graph base-labels associated with each graph into super-classes, where the L^p Wasserstein distance serves as our underlying distance metric. Subsequently, a super-graph constructed based on the super-classes is then fed to our proposed GNN framework which exploits the latent inter-class relationships made explicit by the super-graph to achieve better class label separation among the graphs. We conduct exhaustive empirical evaluations of our proposed method and show that it outperforms both the adaptation of state-of-the-art graph classification methods to few-shot scenario and our naive baseline GNNs.

Several recent works suggest that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models generate richer and more expressive feature embeddings and hence also perform well on relation prediction. However, we observe that these KG embeddings treat triples independently and thus fail to cover the complex and hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. To this effect, our paper proposes a novel attention-based feature embedding that captures both entity and relation features in any given entity’s neighborhood. Additionally, we also encapsulate relation clusters and multi-hop relations in our model.

Typically, these analytics are a part of a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preparation, model building, and model evaluation. General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks execute all steps of such workflows holistically. This holistic view enables these systems to reason about and automatically optimize the entire pipeline. Here, graph and machine learning analytics are known to incur a long runtime since they require multiple passes over the data until convergence is reached. Thus, fault tolerance and a fast-recovery from any intermittent failure is critical for efficient analysis. In this paper, we propose novel fault-tolerant mechanisms for graph and machine learning analytics that run on distributed dataflow systems. We seek to reduce checkpointing costs and shorten failure recovery times. For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks. In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself. Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design. This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing. Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch. In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints. In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and empirical experimental analyses using Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CIDR</abbr> </div> <div id="ew" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Elementary, dear Watson!</div> <div class="author"> <em>Manohar Kaul</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research</em>, Feb 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/gongshow/abstracts/cidr2017_66.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In T̈he Sign of Four\", Sherlock Holmes makes some very startling inferences about Watson’s whereabouts by informing Watson that he was at the Wigmore Street Post Office earlier that morning.

However, hash codes significantly depend on the similarity, which prohibits users from adjusting the similarity at query time. In this paper, we propose multiple purpose LSH (mp-LSH) which shares the hash codes for different similarities. By using vector/code augmentation and cover tree techniques, our mp-LSH supports L2, cosine, and inner product similarities, and their corresponding weighted sums, where the weights can be adjusted at query time. It also allows us to modify the importance of pre-defined groups of features. Thus, mp-LSH enables us, for example, to retrieve similar items to a query with the user preference taken into account, to find a similar material to a query with some properties (stability, utility, etc.) optimized, and to turn on or off a part of multi-modal information (brightness, color, audio, text, etc.) in image/video retrieval.

Data cleaning systems must be able to treat data quality rules holistically, to incorporate heterogeneous constraints within a single routine, and to automate data curation. We propose an approach to data cleaning based on statistical relational learning (SRL). We argue that a formalism - Markov logic - is a natural fit for modeling data quality rules. Our approach allows for the usage of probabilistic joint inference over interleaved data cleaning rules to improve data quality.

General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks typically execute such pipelines while analyzing the entire pipeline in a holistic manner to further optimize the processing. A majority of big graph processing algorithms are iterative in nature and incur a long runtime, therefore it becomes all the more necessary to tolerate and recover quickly from any intermittent failures. In this work, we propose an efficient fault-tolerance mechanism for iterative graph processing on distributed data-flow systems with the objective to reduce the checkpointing cost and failure recovery time. Rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, we write checkpoints in an unblocking manner. Also, in comparison to the typical unblocking checkpointing approach of managing checkpoints independently, we inject the checkpoints into the dataflow itself. It not only inherits the advantage of a low execution latency without breaking the pipelined tasks, but simplifies the system design to coordinate the checkpoint writing. Further, we achieve speedier recovery, i.e., confined recovery, by using the local log files on each node to avoid a complete re- computation from scratch. Our theoretical studies as well as experimental analysis on Flink give further insight into our fault- tolerance strategies and show that they are more efficient than blocking checkpointing and complete recovery for iterative graph processing on dataflow systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2015</h2> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">PVLDB</abbr> </div> <div id="nlubsdqt" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">New Lower and Upper Bounds for Shortest Distance Queries on Terrains</div> <div class="author"> <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, and Christian S.

As shortest-path computation, an integral element of query processing, is inherently expensive on terrains, a key approach to enabling efficient query processing is to reduce the need for exact shortest-path computation in query processing. We develop new lower and upper bounds on terrain shortest distances that are provably tighter than any existing bounds. Unlike existing bounds, the new bounds do not rely on the quality of the triangulation. We show how use of the new bounds speeds up query processing by reducing the need for exact distance computations. Speedups of of nearly an order of magnitude are demonstrated empirically for well-known spatial queries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">PIKM</abbr> </div> <div id="rapriori" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">R-Apriori : An Efficient Apriori based Algorithm on Spark</div> <div class="author"> Sanjay Rathee, <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, and Arti Kashyap </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>PIKM, Ph.D. student workshop at CIKM</em>, Feb 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/%C2%A0mkaul/papers/pikm09-rathee.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Association rule mining remains a very popular and effective method to extract meaningful information from large datasets. It tries to find possible associations between items in large transaction based datasets. In order to create these associations, frequent patterns have to be generated. The Äpriori\"algorithm along with its set of improved variants, which were one of the earliest proposed frequent pattern generation algorithms still remain a preferred choice due to their ease of implementation and natural tendency to be parallelized. <br> While many efficient single-machine methods for Apriori exist, the massive amount of data available these days is far beyond the capacity of a single machine. Hence, there is a need to scale across multiple machines to meet the demands of this ever- growing data. MapReduce is a popular fault-tolerant framework for distributed applications. Nevertheless, heavy disk I/O at each MapReduce operation hinders the implementation of efficient iterative data mining algorithms, such as Apriori, on MapReduce platforms. <br> A newly proposed in-memory distributed dataflow platform called Spark overcomes the disk I/O bottlenecks in MapReduce. Therefore, Spark presents an ideal platform for distributed Apriori. However, in the implementation of Apriori, the most computationally expensive task is the generation of candidate sets having all possible pairs for singleton frequent items and comparing each pair with every transaction record. Here, we propose a new approach which dramatically reduces this computational complexity by eliminating the candidate generation step and avoiding costly comparisons. <br> We conduct in-depth experiments to gain insight into the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our studies show that our approach outperforms the classical Apriori and state-of-the-art on Spark by many times for different datasets.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2014</h2> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">PVLDB</abbr> </div> <div id="ttmfttd" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Terrain-Toolkit: A Multi-Functional Tool for Terrain Data (Demo)</div> <div class="author"> Qi Wang, <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, Cheng Long, and Raymond Chi-Wing Wong </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of Very Large Databases</em>, Feb 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.iith.ac.in/%C2%A0mkaul/papers/terrain_analyzer.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Terrain data is becoming increasingly popular both in industry and in academia.

Further, costs such as travel time and GHG emissions are time-dependent and uncertain. To support such uses, we propose techniques that enable the construction of a multi-cost, time-dependent, uncertain graph (MTUG) model of a road network based on GPS data from vehicles that traversed the road network. Based on the MTUG, we define optimal routes that consider multiple costs and time-dependent uncertainty, and we propose efficient algorithms to retrieve optimal routes for a given source-destination pair and a start time.

For example, to enable effective vehicle routing, weighted-graph models of transportation networks are used, where the weight of an edge captures some cost associated with traversing the edge, e.g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or travel time. It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that all edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can be extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network. However, GPS trajectory data typically lack the coverage needed to assign weights to all edges. This paper formulates and addresses the problem of annotating all edges in a road network with travel cost based weights from a set of trips in the network that cover only a small fraction of the edges, each with an associated ground-truth travel cost. A general framework is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the problem is modeled as a regression problem and solved by minimizing a judiciously designed objective function that takes into account the topology of the road network. In particular, the use of weighted PageRank values of edges is explored for assigning appropriate weights to all edges, and the property of directional adjacency of edges is also taken into account to assign weights. Empirical studies with weights capturing travel time and GHG emissions on two road networks (Skagen, Denmark, and North Jutland, Denmark) offer insight into the design properties of the proposed techniques and offer evidence that the techniques are effective.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">MDM</abbr> </div> <div id="basnengits" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Building Accurate 3D Spatial Networks to Enable Next Generation Intelligent Transportation Systems <i>(Best Paper Award)</i> </div> <div class="author"> <em>Manohar Kaul</em>, Bin Yang, and Christian S.

We propose a novel filtering and lifting framework that augments a standard 2D spatial network model with elevation information extracted from massive aerial laser scan data and thus yields an accurate 3D model. We present a filtering technique that is capable of pruning irrelevant laser scan points in a single pass, but assumes that the 2D network fits in internal memory and that the points are appropriately sorted. We also provide an external-memory filtering technique that makes no such assumptions. During lifting, a triangulated irregular network (TIN) surface is constructed from the remaining points. The 2D network is projected onto the TIN, and a 3D network is constructed by means of interpolation.

So-called eco-routing and eco-driving are able to substantially reduce GHG emissions caused by vehicular transportation. To enable these, it is necessary to be able to reliably quantify the emissions of vehicles as they travel in a spatial network. Thus, a number of models have been proposed that aim to quantify the emissions of a vehicle based on GPS data from the vehicle and a 3D model of the spatial network the vehicle travels in. We develop an evaluation framework, called EcoMark, for such environmental impact models. In addition, we survey all eleven state-of-the-art impact models known to us.
