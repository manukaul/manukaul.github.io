I head the <strong> Next Generation AI Research Center</strong> at <strong>Fujitsu, Japan</strong>. Prior to this, I led the AI and AI Security labs at Fujitsu Research India. My research focuses on applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis), geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representations), and optimal transport. I develop practical ML systems grounded in strong theoretical foundations.

Previously, I was a tenured Associate Professor in the <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/" target="blank">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://iith.ac.in/" target="blank">IIT Hyderabad</a>, where I founded the <a href="https://krama.cse.iith.ac.in" target="blank">क्रम (Krama) Lab</a>. I actively collaborated with academia and industry to create next-generation AI solutions.

Before academia, I spent 9 years in industry as a technical, systems, and database architect at firms like <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/" target="blank">Oracle</a>, working on mission-critical big data systems. This experience shaped my vision for industry-relevant AI research.
My academic journey began as a Master’s student in the <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/" target="blank">Uppsala Database Laboratory</a> at <a href="https://www.uu.se/en" target="blank">Uppsala University</a>, Sweden, under <a href="https://user.it.uu.se/~torer/" target="blank">Prof. Tore Risch</a>, working on near-future prediction of moving-object trajectories. I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="https://cs.au.dk/" target="blank">Aarhus University</a>, Denmark, advised by <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/christian-s-jensen" target="blank">Prof. Christian S. Jensen</a>, focusing on fast pathfinding algorithms on massive 3D meshes. I later completed a postdoc at <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/" target="blank">TU Berlin</a> in the <a href="https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/" target="blank">DIMA Group</a> under <a href="https://www.bimos.tu-berlin.de/menue/bimos_people/members/professors/volker_markl/" target="blank">Prof. Volker Markl</a>, working on scalable machine learning and locality-sensitive hashing.
